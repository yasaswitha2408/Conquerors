Title of the Project: USE OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY TO CALCULATE WATER FOOTPRINTS FOR DAILY USE ITEMS
**Introduction:**
In a world where water scarcity is a growing concern, this project addresses the significant issue of water wastage. A considerable amount of water is currently being wasted, largely due to a lack of awareness about individual water usage. In regions like India, where water scarcity is pressing, bridging this knowledge gap becomes crucial. The project introduces a digital system to calculate and monitor the water footprints of daily use items. However, our goal goes beyond quantification; it aims to serve as a catalyst for change by raising awareness about the substantial water wastage tied to our daily products. Water footprints represent the total freshwater used throughout a product's lifecycle, offering a tangible measure of our ecological impact. Astonishingly, many individuals are unaware of the specific water consumption tied to each product. The project seeks to disrupt this paradigm and empower individuals to make informed choices, reducing the considerable water wastage ingrained in our current consumption patterns. In summary, the project strives to tackle water wastage by introducing a digital tool that calculates water footprints and, in doing so, raise awareness about the environmental impact of daily choices.
**Proposed Methodology: **
The proposed system encompasses the creation of a user-centric digital platform equipped with a water footprint calculator. Users input data related to the product or service by scanning of barcode of the product, and the system employs sophisticated algorithms to calculate both direct and indirect water usage. Additionally, real-time monitoring, ensures that users have up-to-date information on their water footprint. The system aims to be accessible through various devices, including web and mobile platforms, making it convenient for users to track and manage their water usage.

What is Water Footprint?
The water footprint is a way to assess the environmental impact of water use. It considers not only the water used for personal consumption but also the water used in the production chain of goods and services. Water footprints are categorized into three types: green, blue, and grey, representing different sources and environmental impacts of water use.

How is Water Footprint Calculated?
Calculating water footprint involves assessing the water used in various stages of the supply chain, from raw material extraction to production, distribution, and consumption. The calculation considers the volume of water used and the environmental impact associated with different types of water use. Water footprint assessments help identify opportunities for reducing water consumption and improving sustainability.

Why We Need to Know About Water Footprints?
Understanding water footprints is crucial for sustainable water management. It helps individuals, businesses, and policymakers make informed decisions about water use. By knowing the impact of our activities on water resources, we can work towards reducing our water footprint and ensuring the availability of water for future generations.
